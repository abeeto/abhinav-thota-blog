[Hook: The "AWS experience required" problem]
[What this project will teach you - bullet list]
[Why this is better than tutorials]

### The Tech Stack Decision You'll Actually Have to Make

[Why most devs default to React/Next.js + Vercel]
[The question you need to ask: what does this site actually need?]
[Realizing 99% static content doesn't need React]
[What you'll learn: matching tech to requirements, not just using what's familiar]

## Discovering Static Site Generators

[What JSX actually costs you - bundle size, load times]
[Finding 11ty (or another SSG)]
[How templating languages like Nunjucks give you JSX benefits without the cost]
[Alpine.js for the little interactivity you need]
[What you'll learn: how the web actually works, what browsers need vs what devs want]

## Understanding CDNs and Why They Matter

[What a CDN actually does - explain like they're new to this]
[Why static files + CDN = perfect match]
[How this makes your site faster globally]
[What you'll learn: content delivery, edge computing basics]

## The AWS Setup: S3 + CloudFront

[What S3 buckets are - object storage, not a database]
[How CloudFront sits in front of S3]
[The flow: HTTP request → CloudFront → S3 bucket → files]
[What you'll learn: cloud storage, CDN integration, basic AWS architecture]

## Automating Deployment with GitHub Actions

[The manual way vs the automated way]
[Setting up GitHub Actions workflow]
[Configuring secrets in GitHub]
[Writing IAM policies to authorize GitHub → AWS]
[What you'll learn: CI/CD pipelines, AWS security, automation]

## Why This Was Worth It

[What you understand now that you didn't before]
[Cost comparison: AWS vs Vercel]
[Speed improvements]
[The confidence of understanding your infrastructure]
